/**
 * @file Foundation.hpp
 * @brief The one place that knows whether the LplPlugin foundation is present.
 *
 * Every repository in the project must build, run and be TESTED on its own. LplPlugin
 * builds without LplKernel; this repository builds without either. The foundation
 * modules (core, math) are therefore an *enhancement*, detected at configure time,
 * never a hard requirement — the same arrangement LplKernel already uses for the
 * engine itself, where a missing submodule sets LPL_PLUGIN_UNAVAILABLE and the kernel
 * still boots.
 *
 * Two builds, and the difference between them is deliberate:
 *
 *   - **with the foundation** (`LPL_HAS_FOUNDATION`): the real `lpl::core` types and
 *     assertions, and `lpl::math::Fixed32`/CORDIC are reachable. This is the build
 *     that can honour the determinism contract and be compiled -ffreestanding into
 *     the kernel.
 *   - **standalone**: primitive ALIASES only, declared here. They are aliases of the
 *     very same standard types `lpl::core` uses, so the two cannot disagree — but
 *     Fixed32 and CORDIC are NOT emulated, and no substitute is offered.
 *
 * That last point is the honest part. A fake fixed-point type would let a standalone
 * build claim a parity it cannot possibly have, and the first person to trust that
 * claim would be debugging a divergence that no test could reproduce. So the
 * standalone build is host-only by construction: targets that need the determinism
 * contract are SKIPPED when the foundation is absent, not stubbed.
